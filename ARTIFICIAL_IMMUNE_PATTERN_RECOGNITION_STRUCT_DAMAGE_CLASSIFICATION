"""
AIRS Algorithm (Step-by-Step)
Initialization:

Randomly generate an initial set of memory cells (detectors).

Affinity Calculation:

Measure similarity (or distance) between input samples and memory cells.

Clonal Selection:

Select the best-matching memory cells.

Clone them based on their affinity (better = more clones).

Hypermutation:

Apply mutation to the clones (more mutation for lower affinity).

Selection:

Evaluate clones and replace weak memory cells with better ones.

Classification:

For a new sample, find the closest matching memory cell and assign its label.

Evaluation:

Compare predictions with true labels to calculate accuracy or performance.
