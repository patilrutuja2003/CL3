Implement Union, Intersection, Complement and Difference operations on fuzzy sets. Also create fuzzy relations by Cartesian product of any two fuzzy sets and perform max-min composition on any two fuzzy relations.

CODE:
import numpy as np
 
# Function to perform Union operation on fuzzy sets
def fuzzy_union(A, B):
    return np.maximum(A, B)
 
# Function to perform Intersection operation on fuzzy sets
def fuzzy_intersection(A, B):
    return np.minimum(A, B)
 
# Function to perform Complement operation on a fuzzy set
def fuzzy_complement(A):
    return 1 - A
 
# Function to perform Difference operation on fuzzy sets
def fuzzy_difference(A, B):
    return np.maximum(A, 1 - B)
 
# Function to create fuzzy relation by Cartesian product of two fuzzy sets
def cartesian_product(A, B):
    return np.outer(A, B)
 
# Function to perform Max-Min composition on two fuzzy relations
def max_min_composition(R, S):
    return np.max(np.minimum.outer(R, S), axis=1)
 
# Example usage
A = np.array([0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8])  # Fuzzy set A
B = np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9])  # Fuzzy set B
 
# Operations on fuzzy sets
union_result = fuzzy_union(A, B)
intersection_result = fuzzy_intersection(A, B)
complement_A = fuzzy_complement(A)
difference_result = fuzzy_difference(A, B)
 
print("Union:", union_result)
print("Intersection:", intersection_result)
print("Complement of A:", complement_A)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
 
# Fuzzy relations
R = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.4])  # Fuzzy relation R
S = np.array([0.6, 0.3, 0.7])  # Fuzzy relation S
 
# Cartesian product of fuzzy relations
cartesian_result = cartesian_product(R, S)
 
# Max-Min composition of fuzzy relations
composition_result = max_min_composition(R, S)
 
print("Cartesian product of R and S:")
print(cartesian_result)
 
print("Max-Min composition of R and S:")
print(composition_result)

#OUTPUT:
#Union: [0.3 0.5 0.7 0.9]
#Intersection: [0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8]
#Complement of A: [0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2]
#Difference: [0.7 0.5 0.6 0.8]

#Cartesian product of R and S:
#[[0.12 0.06 0.14]
 #[0.3  0.15 0.35]
 #[0.24 0.12 0.28]]
#Max-Min composition of R and S:
#[0.2 0.5 0.4]
